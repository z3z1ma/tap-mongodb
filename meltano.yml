            These props are passed directly to pymongo MongoClient allowing the
            tap user full flexibility not provided in any other Mongo tap.

          description:
            Optional path to a YAML file containing the mongo configuration
            properties.

          description:
            Optionally add a prefix for all streams, useful if ingesting
            from multiple shards/clusters via independent tap-mongodb configs.
          value: ""
        - name: optional_replication_key
          description: |
            Make the replication key optional. If set to true, the tap will
            not fail if the replication key is not found in a document.
        - name: is_timestamp_replication_key
          description: |
            This setting allows the tap to use a date-like incremental replication key, 
            such as an usual `updatedAt`column.

          description: |
            A list of databases to include. If this is set,

          description: |
            If set to true, the tap will infer the schema from a sample of the
            documents in each collection. If set to false, the tap will
            use a default schema for each collection.
